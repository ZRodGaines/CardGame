Here is a small and simple 'card game' that was made in java

GitHub: https://github.com/ZRodGaines/CardGame/

This is built purely in Java

I enjoyed creating the card shuffler as it proved somewhat challeneging as allowed me to do what was in the scope of the project in what was an interesting way for me.

This is ran through the console of your IDE of choice frome the 'App.class' file.
